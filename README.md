This is an attempt at reproducing Rumelhart and McClelland's (1986) connectionist experiment described  in the book Paralell Distributed Processing, chapter "On learning the past tense of english verbs", with Brazilian Portuguese as a target language.

The coding and decoding functions are still under development.

# Wickelfeatures 

A phoneme is one of the units of sound that distinguish one word from another in a particular language.

Each phoneme has its own phonological features. According to Rumelhart and McClelland's description, the phoneme 'd', for example, can be characterized by a set of 4 features:  

  - Interrupted
  - Stop
  - Middle
  - Voiced

In a trigram of phonemes, each phoneme may be ascribed features allowing for 48 possible combinations. A wickelfeature is any one of those combinations.
